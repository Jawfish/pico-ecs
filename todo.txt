implement entity creation factory (?)
add more thorough cases for individual unit tests
add assert messages
refactor entity id to be determined by the manager; don't directly modify the id of the entity object, as this persists across managers and entities
refactor tests to test behavior over specific implementation
switch fields to private and use getters/setters (?)
fix mixing using objects and strings (hasComponent takes an object, hasAllComponents takes an array of strings)
clean up and add docstrings
merge groups and tags; use tags for entities and collections for components
add:
    entity.ts:
        hasCollection()
